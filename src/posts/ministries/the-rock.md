During school hours, we work with young people from school years 6 to 11 (10-16 years) offering early intervention and re-engagement activities. Four evenings a week our doors are open to all young people who want somewhere safe to hang out, to play sports, or to learn new skills.

**So what makes the Rock special?** The mix of dedicated daytime educational support and open access evening work allows us to engage with young people in diverse ways over long periods of time – making our goal of Transforming Lives a reality. The Rock brings together fantastic facilities, a dedicated and experienced team of volunteers, employees and students and strong local partnerships. We see long-term partnership at the heart of all we do – partnerships with young people, with schools, churches, agencies, businesses.. work means that We are particularly grateful to the vision and ongoing support of The Diocese of Gloucester which makes it possible to offer such an inspiring space to vulnerable and disadvantaged young people.

Life at the Rock is an adventure, we have seen young people and the team grow through challenges, we have known God’s generous provision and are very aware that there is so much potential to come. In the words of one young person; ‘You have practically turned my life around’. Please do consider joining us on that adventure – in whatever way you are able.
