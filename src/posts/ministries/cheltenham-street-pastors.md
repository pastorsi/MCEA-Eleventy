# Who Are We?
Street Pastors are an inter-denominational Church response to urban problems, engaging with people by caring, listening and talking. We are church members who are willing to offer support, practical help and a visible ministry to those who are out in the town late at night. We reassure folk who may feel vulnerable, help reduce the fear of crime, provide a listening ear and offer genuine, non-judgmental pastoral support to those who need help. We are not about preaching but about helping people – the gospel is at the heart of what we do and why we do it but not at the forefront of what we say.

Cheltenham has the third largest night time economy in the South West giving our Churches a wonderful opportunity to serve the community.

Cheltenham Street Pastors commissioned the first twenty-one pastors on 1st December 2009 and has operated successfully since then on Saturday and Saturday nights. We now have over 50 trained Street Pastors who come from 30 churches in Cheltenham and the surrounding area.

The local Police Inspector has said that “Street Pastors help to make Cheltenham town centre a safe place. They act as a safety net to pick up vulnerable people who may be casualties of the night time economy”. In addition, they said that they have no doubt that Street Pastors have made a contribution to the fall in crime in Cheltenham.
