**Cheltenham Foodbank** exists as a support to agencies, charities and churches, in order to give a person in need an emergency 3-day food supply. We rely on donations from the public and distribute our food through 3 distribution centres, at Elim (Wednesdays), St Pauls Church (Fridays) and Salvation Army (Mondays).

We are also part of the wider network of groups helping to tackle food provision in Cheltenham, including Feed Cheltenham.
Opening times for clients: 11am-3pm (currently Wednesdays and Fridays)

Opening times for donations (to be dropped off at Elim, address below): Tuesdays & Thursdays, 10am-4pm (exceptions can be arranged, alternatively, drop off at a supermarket with a foodbank collection point, such as Asda or Tesco).

Address: St Georges Road, Cheltenham, GL50 3ED
