### Who We Are
Family Space is currently a joint venture between Cheltenham YMCA and four local churches in West Cheltenham.

Family Space recognises that parents can often need a place to go where they can engage in activities with their children as well as spending time with other parents or having space for themselves.


### What We Do
Family Space offers
* Stay and play sessions for parents and 0-3 year olds
* Time Out for mums - with a creche for 0-3s
* Befrienders - having someone to help with the children, the shopping or just listen
* Child Contact Centre - a place for children and parents to meet up when the family unit has been separated
* Book and Toy libraries
* Support to our partner project - Agape Family Centre in Vaslui, Romania
