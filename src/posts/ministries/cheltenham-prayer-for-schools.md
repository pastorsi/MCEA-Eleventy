# The Vision

Every school … a prayed for school!

CPFSN is God’s vision which He has enabled to come into being and to flourish for the past 20 years

* Praying for all 63 Cheltenham schools, the University, National Star Centre, the Rock, and Gloucestershire Hospital Education Service
* Supporting pupils, parents, staff and governors
* Building a network of Christians involved in schools by
* Providing a prayer meeting each term hosted by a different school, with worship, speakers introducing prayer topics, and refreshments enabling parents, teachers, governors, ministers, youth workers and Christian charities working in schools to get to meet and work together.
