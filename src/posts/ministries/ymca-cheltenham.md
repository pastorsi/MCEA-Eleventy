At YMCA Cheltenham we believe every person should have the opportunity and support to realise their potential in body, mind and spirit. Founded in 1855, YMCA Cheltenham has been a major provider of accommodation, sports facilities and youth work for more than 165 years and, holding fast to our Christian roots and ethos, we aim to work with the whole person - body, mind and spirit. 

YMCA Cheltenham has always provided opportunities and services suitable for the day. Being an independent local charity, we know what the local community needs and we are able to respond quickly to those ever-changing needs.

### ACCOMMODATION
We have three housing projects where we provide safe and secure accommodation for up to 150 people who were formerly homeless or living in unsuitable accommodation.
* Vittoria Walk, Cheltenham
* St. Michael's House, Gloucester
* Potter's Place, Gloucester

Our experienced support teams work closely with each resident to develop the skills necessary to live unsupported in the community. Each person is treated as an individual and encouraged to reach their full potential in all areas of their lives. We also have two affordable accommodation projects in west Cheltenham, Dulverton Court and James Smith Row providing 31 high quality studio flats.

### HEALTH AND WELLBEING
At the YMCA Cheltenham Sports Centre in College Drive, Cheltenham, we provide a range of organised activities and classes, catering for the very young through to the not so young! Martial arts, table tennis and badminton are some of the activities available to young people, and for our older members we have our very popular EnergYse fitness classes (for the over 50s), walking football, table tennis, short tennis and badminton. 

We also have a small fitness suite with a range of equipment. Our sports centre is friendly and welcoming. Not only is it a place to focus on getting and staying fit, but it provides a community network and support for those who, for example, have suffered family bereavement, or are recovering from stroke and other conditions. 

Our membership and class fees are kept intentionally low as we want our facilities to be available to all who want to join us. The Sports Centre is also available for community groups and individuals to hire, for example for a regular weekly netball or football training session.

### YMCA HISTORY AND HERITAGE
YMCA is the largest and oldest youth charity in the world. In 1844, 22 year-old draper George Williams joined eleven friends to organise the first Young Menâ€™s Christian Association (YMCA), a refuge of Bible study and prayer for young men seeking escape from the hazards of life on the streets of London. 

YMCA has grown to serve more than 65 million people in 120 countries regardless of age, race, gender, sexual orientation or socio-economic background. Today, YMCA operates in 700 communities across England and Wales. The 572,000 young people we help each year are firmly at the heart of what we do, supported by more than 5,400 members of staff and 4,400 volunteers across 847 locations.
