**Love Cheltenham is an informal grouping of churches from across the historic denominations and newer church networks.**

Under the banner "Love Cheltenham", we gather around the life-changing Gospel of Jesus Christ with a desire to bring the love of Jesus to Cheltenham. We aim to collaborate as Christians on projects that work towards the good of our town.
