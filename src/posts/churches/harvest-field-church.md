Harvest Field Church is an independent evangelical church serving Cheltenham and the surrounding area of Gloucestershire. Our Sunday services are in our church hall which is in the Oakley area of Cheltenham just off the Prestbury Road.

The three key features characterise Harvest Field Church:

1. A family atmosphere where each member's contribution is valued.  
2. Inspired, heart-felt music provides the preparation or setting for a continual expression of adoration for the Father and joy in His presence.  
3. A hunger to know God and the Truth revealed in His Word.
