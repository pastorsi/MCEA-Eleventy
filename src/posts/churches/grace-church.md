Church isn’t a building; it’s a family of people who believe in Jesus. At Grace Church, we are a growing family of around 70 adults and 50 children, at many different ages and stages.

We are a reformed evangelical church committed to four core values:  
The Bible, Grace, Community and Mission.

Our mission: Making disciples of Jesus by sharing God’s message of grace.
