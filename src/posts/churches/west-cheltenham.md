## Our Vision
Our vision is to see ***communities and places buzzing with the extraordinary presence of Jesus.***


## Who We Are
We are one united church across three key locations:
- St Mark's (St Mark's)
- St Barnabas (Rowanfield)
- St Aidan & St Silas (Hesters Way)

## Join Us

We meet across all locations at 10.30am on Sundays for worship and teaching:

* St Mark's - band led contemporary worship with age-appropriate children's groups and live teaching.
* St Barnabas- recorded contemporary worship with live teaching.
* St Aidan & St Silas - more traditional piano and vocal led worship with live teaching.

In addition to this, St Mark's has a more traditional service at 9am each Sunday with organ-led hymns and live teaching, as well as a midweek communion on Wednesday's at 10am.

Join us every Sunday LIVE on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUTYgxYwY_LSP2AekX4_kRA) at 10.30am.
