We are a very friendly group at Salem, committed to loving God, loving each other and loving God's world. Our membership ranges from young families to people in their 90's, so in our worship we use both new songs as well as more traditional hymns. We aim for vibrant services where we know we have met with God and been touched by His Spirit. In addition to our members groups, outreach and youth work, we also engage in mission locally and globally through prayer, funds and participation.

We currently hold hybrid services, streaming on YouTube at 10.30am whilst at the same time worshipping in the building, and producing DVD's for our more restricted members.

Our Hub is a drop in coffee morning that we hold outside on Tuesdays, while our Friday Tots group and Sunday morning Junior Church meet in the building. Most of our other meetings are currently on Zoom. We use our noticeboard and front area to provide activities and engagement for the streets around our building, and are working with Gloucester Road Primary School to support disadvantaged families and provide reflective spaces.

Our Minister is Rev Andy Grice, Secretary Andrew McFarlane and Treasurer Helen Alderton.
