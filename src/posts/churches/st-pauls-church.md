## **Who we are**
We’re a family church and we aim to be fun, friendly and full of the life of Jesus. We believe and teach the whole Bible and rely on the Holy Spirit to empower us to live for Jesus.

## **Values**
We articulate our purpose in terms of *Encountering Jesus, Making Disciples and Transforming Community* and our corporate mission is focused on the community of St Paul’s, however we want to empower all our members to transform whatever communities they are part of.

## **Gatherings**
We love gathering together to worship both in the big on a Sunday and in the small, midweek in people’s homes. We are pleased to have relaunched our gatherings in-person, and continue to livestream on our YouTube channel. We also believe that the core of following Jesus is an individual, personal relationship with Him expressed in private prayer, study and other practices.
