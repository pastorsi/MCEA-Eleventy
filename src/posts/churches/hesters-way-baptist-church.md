# Vision and Values
## Our vision:
We want Hesters Way Baptist Church to enable the community to know Jesus and make Jesus known. Jesus called us to be his disciples (or followers) who share the good news contained in His manifesto recorded in Luke 4:18-19  
> The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour
## Our values:
With the help of God’s Holy Spirit, we want to be:
* Jesus followers (with our L plates on)  
* Good news people (for Hesters Way community, Cheltenham and beyond)  
* Bible do-ers (rather than just hearers)  
* Generous disciples (mirroring the generous love of God)  
* Transformed transformers (being change agents, while being changed by God)

## Leadership: 
Along with our Deacons our leadership team is made up of James Raynor (working full time at church and will soon begin training as a minister), Rev Tim Welch (part time minister) and Katie Youlton (part time worker).

## Services: 
Our Sunday services at 10:30 in the church and we continue to live stream these onto Zoom for those who can't be with us. On the second Sunday of the month we have a 'family service' and that same evening we hold a Praise and Prayer at 6pm. For further details see our website.
