# Who we are

Cambray is an evangelical Baptist Church in the heart of Cheltenham.  We have around 300 attending our main worship service and a vibrant programme of ministries for all ages.  There are specialist ministries for children, young people, 20s & 30s, students, women and men, and older folk. We have a full programme of activities, and outreach events throughout the year.

# Ministry Staff
**Lead Pastor:** Alwyn Barry  
**Associate Pastor:** Tim Martin  
**Youth Worker:** Shany Scorzone

# Services:
We meet to worship together at 10:30am (which includes Creche, Kids work, and Youth work) both livestreamed [(Live Stream)](https://www.youtube.com/c/CambrayBaptistChurch) and in-person.  In more normal times we also have an evening service at 6:30pm.

We seek to be contemporary in our worship, whilst providing for all ages, and make space for in-depth Bible Teaching which is applied through Prayer Ministry and followed up within our mid-week Small Groups.

# Throughout the week

During the week we have a vibrant programme of ministries for all generations and demographics, most of which continue to run on-line.

We are seeking to engage with the community around our town centre location and through cross-town initiatives, many of which are done in collaboration with other churches, including CAP Money Course and Debt Counselling, FoodBank, YMCA, Street Pastors and much more beside.

Full details of all these are available on our website: [Cambray.org](https://www.cambray.org/)
