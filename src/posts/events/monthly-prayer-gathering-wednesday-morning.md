Following the meeting on January 30th 2025 to discuss the future of MCEA and few a people from churches and organisations in the area asked if we could regularly meet for prayer. Wednesday morning at 9.30am was a time they could all make,

As a result, from Wednesday 5th March we will gather at 9.30am on the first Wednesday of the month. The gathering will be at the Youth for Christ office at Leckhampton Baptist Church. 

Please feel free to join us!
