## Calling church and ministry leaders!

On the 8th May we are hosting a “Sing the Bible” event called “Slugs and Bugs Live!” here at Cambray Baptist Church. We would love for as many children and families to come along as possible as Randall Goodgame isn’t in the UK very often. So please promote this event to your congregation and the wider community.

Randall Goodgame produces excellent songs and other materials for children and families to engage with the Bible and this is a great opportunity to come together and have lots of fun as we engage with God’s word.

**When:** May 8, 2024 @ 5:30 pm – 6:30 pm  
**Where:** Cambray Baptist Church, Cambray Place, Cheltenham GL50 1JS  
**Booking:** [Cambray Churchsuite booking page](https://cambray.churchsuite.com/events/b3hnfje0)

**How much:**
Single ticket = £10.00  
Family ticket (up to 2 adults and 4 children) = £40.00  
Please note children 3yrs and under go FREE and MUST be accompanied by a paying adult.
