## The Cotswold Bible Festival 2024

We would love it if you could join hundreds of others from across the region who have already booked for this family day event on Saturday 23rd November at the Cheltenham Ladies' College.

We have international speakers, professional sung worship for young and old, fringe events and festival fun galore! The festival is organised on behalf of Keswick Ministries, who organise the summer Keswick Conferences, so it is under an 'umbrella' which will be well known to many.

This year's theme is "Sure - Gospel Confidence in Uncertain Times"

Please share this with your congregation. We look forward to seeing you.
