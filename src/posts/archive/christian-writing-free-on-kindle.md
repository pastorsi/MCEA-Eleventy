**Dwight L. Moody** founder of the Moody Bible Institute wrote in amazing terms of Charles H. Mackintosh's writings. **Charles H. Mackintosh** was a remarkable 19th century Christian preacher and writer of Bible commentaries.

C. H. Mackintosh died on 2 November 1896 shortly after entering his 76th year and was buried in Cheltenham Cemetery. (See the photo above.) I wonder how many in Cheltenham have ever heard of him, even among the Christian community of this lovely Gloucestershire town.

**D. L. Moody wrote about Mackintosh's Notes on the Pentateuch**, "_I had my attention called to C.H.M.'s notes, and was so much pleased and at the same time profited by the way they opened up the Scripture truth, that I secured at once all the writings of the same author, and if they could not be replaced, would rather part with my entire library, excepting my Bible, than with these writings. They have been to me a very key to the Scriptures._" [See the Wikipedia entry.](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Henry_Mackintosh#cite_note-stempublishing.com-1 "Entry in Wikipedia for C. H. Mackintosh.")

I have been studying and preaching scripture for almost fifty years and his Notes on the book of Exodus both affirm my background in the word and at the same time open up a whole new horizon of wonderful revelation of God's plan and purpose in Christ found in scripture from Genesis to Revelation. 

I have no idea exactly where that grave stone is in Cheltenham Cemetary. Does anyone know?
