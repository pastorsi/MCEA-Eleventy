**The following is the basis of faith statement affirmed by the participating churches and ministries:**

*The one true God* who lives eternally in three persons – the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

*The love, grace and sovereignty of God* in creating, sustaining, ruling, redeeming and judging the world.

*The divine inspiration* and supreme authority of the Old and New Testament Scriptures, which are the written Word of God – fully trustworthy for faith and conduct.

*The dignity of all people*, made male and female in God’s image to love, be holy and care for creation, yet corrupted by sin, which incurs divine wrath and judgement.

*The incarnation of God’s eternal Son*, the Lord Jesus Christ – born of the virgin Mary; truly divine and truly human, yet without sin.

*The atoning sacrifice of Christ on the cross*: dying in our place, paying the price of sin and defeating evil, so reconciling us with God.

*The bodily resurrection of Christ*, the first fruits of our resurrection; his ascension to the Father, and his reign and mediation as the only Saviour of the world.

*The justification of sinners* solely by the grace of God through faith in Christ.

*The ministry of God the Holy Spirit*, who leads us to repentance, unites us with Christ through new birth, empowers our discipleship and enables our witness.

*The church, the body of Christ* both local and universal, the priesthood of all believers — given life by the Spirit and endowed with the Spirit’s gifts to worship God and proclaim the gospel, promoting justice and love.

*The personal and visible return of Jesus Christ* to fulfil the purposes of God, who will raise all people to judgement, bring eternal life to the redeemed and eternal condemnation to the lost, and establish a new heaven and new earth.

*Evangelical Alliance UK is the original publisher of this basis of faith statement.*
